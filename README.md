> Kaffi , the Arabic for "Keep Going", is an independent nonprofit organization founded to ease the burden on the shoulders of the students and allow them to carry on their education. We at Kaffi, know very well the situation of the Lebanese students abroad as most of us have been through this before. We also know that the current economic crisis affecting Lebanon is jeopardizing these students' chance of continuing their education. This has driven us to take immediate action and do our best to help! 
> 
> Kaffi-lb is a website implemented to enable Lebanese students studying abroad to submit scholarship applications, donators to donate money to support the NGO, activists to submit volunteering applications, and connect students with mentors across the world through a chat system.
#### At Kaffi, we believe that education is the best form of investment for the future of an individual, a family and a community.

### User Stories
- As a student, I want to be able to apply for scholarships and connect with mentors easily.
- As a mentor, I want to connect with students through a private chatting system.
- As a donator, I want to be able to donate money online for the NGO.
- As an activist, I want to volunteer with the NGO by submitting an online form.

Note that no styling library or theme was used in the project, all from scratch and using pure css modules, except for one component.

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Well app uses:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
  - ðŸš¨ Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
