Our goal is to remove financial obstacles for students and make it possible for them to focus on the educational path they have already invested a lot in. This in return will help create educated young leaders, with an international exposure, who will move Lebanon forward.</p>

          <p className='text'>Amid the current economic crisis and the unresolved dollar-lira problem, we believe that the best way forward for many Lebanese families is investing in their youthâ€™s education abroad. This will prevent these students from losing their current enrollment, allow them to eventually land better jobs and thus help their families and community prosper. Our priority at Kaffi is preventing the scenarios where students abroad are forced to go back, before completing their studies, due to financial hardships.</p>
